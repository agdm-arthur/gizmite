# *GIZMITE*
Gizmite is a simple homepage using HTML, CSS and Javascript, it isn't too fancy.
The homepage contains a search bar with three search options and some bookmarks. Both, search engines and bookmarks can be changed, added or removed by editing `search.js` and `bookmark.js` respectively, only be sure to follow the same formatting.

###### I do not have much time to work on these kind of things now, but I might improve it in the future.
